<div class="about"><h2>About me</h2><p>At my funeral, I want people to say I was someone who cared for the people in his life. My main goal in life, whether it be through college, my career, or my personal life, is to take care of the people around me and get to a place where I can support them in their goals and aspirations. So my career goal is to find a job that lets me live comfortably with enough money to support people around me.</p></div>
